When looking at chaining versus open addressing linear probing and quadratic probing, it would seem that in linear probing, as the table got bigger, it seemed for efficient for chaining. This is expected since for linear probing, once there are multiple collisions, it would be come a hassel to find the specific key and value to be deleted, or it would simply be a hassel to find the key, value to use it. However for chaining, if the number of nodes were to increase greatly, searching through the table and then the linked list would significatly slow down the program. Quadratic probing is almost similar to linear probing, but it doesn't run into collisions as often as linear probing so it is a little faster.
